# Validation-Control
<h2>
 Types of ASP.Net Validation Control </h2>

<h2><li>RequiredFieldValidator.</li></h2> <h3>This is an elementary validation control. Almost all the forms have some fields that are mandatory to be filled up by the user before proceeding forward. The Required Field Validator ensures that such fields are not left empty.</h3>
<h2><li>RangeValidator.</li></h2><h3>The RangeValidator control simply specifies the permitted range within which the input value should fall. This is most helpful for numeral input values such as age or for Date input values.</h3>
<h2><li>RegularExpressionValidator.</li></h2><h2>RegularExpressions, or simply Regex, are patterns that define the format of the text. If the text is in the same format, Regex returns true, else false. It is recommended to read about
Regex if you are not familiar with it. This will also give you an idea about how Regex patterns are formed and how to decipher a Regex pattern.</h2>
<h2><li>CompareValidator.</li></h2><h2>The CompareValidator control compares the value of one control with either a fixed value or a value in another control.</h2>
<h2><li>CustomValidator</h2></li><h2>ASP.Net also allows the freedom of writing your own validator. This eases the task of a developer to validate the form at the client side itself. It also allows putting more complex validations in place. Validations that are business or application-specific can be written using custom validators.</h2>
<h2><li>ValidationSummary</li></h2><h2>The ValidationSummary control does not perform any validation. Its purpose is to display a summary of all the errors on the page.</h2>
